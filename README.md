## üîë Key Features

* Implementation of API REST backend using Express, TypeORM & MySQL
* Identification of users by role to access to the different API consults achieved by tokens using JWT (JSON Web Token)
* Server created with Docker and checked with MySQL Workbench
* Encryptation of the user password using bcrypt
* Data simulated with seeders and generated using faker

## üéØ Project objective

This API is a project focused on the correct implementation of the methods, structure and parts related to the backend of an application that uses a personalized API REST. Focusing on the bussiness model, this project tries to represent how will be the back-end logic for a tattoo shop bussiness, with the users related to the activity, the services the shop offers to customers, the different establishments the company could have and the main feature: the appointments list creation that the shop offers to the customers.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Installation

1. Clone repo
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a Docker container using a MySQL image with the credentials you want to use
4. Create a .env file with your data from the docker you are using
5. Initialize database with the migrations (if you dont do the previous .env creation, will be used not real data):
    ```bash
    npm run run-migrations
    ```
6. Insert data into database using the seeder command:
    ```bash
    npm run seeder
    ```
7. Initialize API:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
8. Use the endpoints on Postman or other applications with the respective elements to get all data

## üîó API

The API makes a relation between the user and the database that is created for the tattoo company InkMasters. The database that is used to achieve this is represented as the following tables:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/databaseDiagram.png">
</div>

As the diagram shows, there are 5 tables: roles, users, services, establishments and appointments. For consulting or modifying the content of each one, are used the following endpoints:

### Endpoints and what does each one

On this section, are shown all the endpoints from my API and what does each one, splitted by the differents methods and tables that are related with the consult. <b>IMPORTANT</b>: The super_admin restricted methods are only usable if a user from the DB has logged in using the /auth/login method and has assigned that role, generating a JWT token saved on the request at the tokenData object inside it. If you are using some applications like Postman to check that security, you have to copy paste it inside the Bearer Token Authorization tab. Moreover, there are some other methods that has to be logged as /profile or GET /appointments.

Also, here you will get 4 different user data of each type of user that are created with the seeder (if you dont execute the seeder, you will not have created this users):

```JSON
{
    {
        "first_name": "Dani",
        "last_name": "Tarrazona",
        "email": "superadmin@superadmin.com",
